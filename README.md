Experimental
============

Place to put stuff I'm playing around with.  This is my foray into using GitHub as a bucket to store the things I'm currently working on.  As I'm investigating new technologies, or if I just want to try something out, I will have a place online where I can easily access those bits and invite others to look at or update them.
